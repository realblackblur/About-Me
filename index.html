            <big>About Me</big>
            
            <pre><h4>
With over four years of professional experience, I have dedicated my career to the intersection of
motion and design. My background spans freelance and collaborative studio environments, where I’ve 
specialized in crafting everything from high-energy character animations to polished, engine-ready 
game assets. I pride myself on my stylistic fluidity—I am equally comfortable working within the    
bright, expressive world of 2D cartooning as I am developing sophisticated assets for immersive game
environments. My work is rooted in a deep understanding of animation principles, ensuring that every
movement tells a story and every design serves a purpose.                                           

Currently, I am expanding my technical toolkit by diving into Web Development and C++. By bridging 
the gap between visual artistry and code, I aim to build even more interactive and seamless digital
experiences. Whether I’m keyframing a character or logic-mapping a new feature, my goal remains the
same: to create impact to the world.
